# Landing Page Status

## ðŸš€ Starting the Landing Page...

The Next.js landing page is now starting up on port 3001.

### Please wait about 10-15 seconds for:
1. Next.js to compile the application
2. Dependencies to load
3. Development server to start

### Then try accessing:
**http://localhost:3001**

### What's Running:
- âœ… **API Server**: http://localhost:3000 (already running)
- ðŸ”„ **Landing Page**: http://localhost:3001 (starting up...)

### If it still doesn't work:

**Option 1 - Check if it started on a different port:**
Try http://localhost:3000 (but this is where your API is)

**Option 2 - Manually start it:**
1. Open a **new terminal window**
2. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd D:\envbuddy\envbuddy-landing
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Look for output like:
   ```
   â–² Next.js 15.x.x
   - Local: http://localhost:3001
   ```

### Expected Landing Page Content:
- Hero: "EnvBuddy â€” Sync .env Files Like a Pro"
- 3-step process (Login â†’ Create Project â†’ Push/Pull)
- Benefits cards
- Modern, clean design
